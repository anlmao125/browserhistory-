        <h2 id="Introduction"> Introduction </h2>
        <p> A web browser is a software application that allows users to access and view informtion.</p>
        <p> The first web browser was created in 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the WorldWideWeb.</p>
        <p> Since then, many browsers have been developed, each with its own features and capabilities.</p>
        <p> In this document, we will explore the history of some of the most popular web browsers.</p>
        <h2 id="InternetExplorer"> Internet Explorer </h2>
        <img src="Logo photos/ie9logo.png" style="height: 200px;" alt="Internet Explorer Logo">
        <p> Internet Explorer was launched by Microsoft in 1995 as part of the Windows 95 operating system. </p>
        <p> It quickly rose to dominance in the early 2000s, capturing over 90% of the global browser market due to its integration with Windows. </p>
        <p> However, it became notorious for security vulnerabilities, slow performance, and lack of support for modern web standards. </p>
        <p> As competitors emerged, particularly Firefox and later Chrome, Internet Explorer’s user base dwindled. Microsoft officially retired the browser in 2022, replacing it with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge"> Microsoft Edge </a>.</p>
        <h2 id="Firefox"> Firefox </h2>
        <img src="Logo photos/Firefox_logo,_2019.svg" style="height: 200px;" alt="Firefox Logo">
        <p> Firefox was released in 2004 by the Mozilla Foundation as a streamlined, open-source alternative to the bloated <a href="https://www-archive.mozilla.org/products/mozilla1.x/"> Mozilla Suite </a>.</p>
        <p> Initially named "Phoenix," it gained popularity for its speed, customizability, and commitment to privacy and web standards. </p>
        <p> Firefox played a major role in breaking Internet Explorer's monopoly but eventually lost significant market share to Google Chrome. </p>
        <p> Despite the competition, Firefox remains a respected browser among users who prioritize open-source software and data privacy. </p>
        <h2 id="Chrome"> Chrome </h2>
        <img src="Logo photos/Google_Chrome_icon_(February_2022).png" style="height: 200px;" alt="Chrome Logo">
        <p> Chrome was introduced by Google in 2008, revolutionizing the browser market with its speed, minimalist design, and advanced JavaScript engine. </p>
        <p> Built on the Chromium open-source project, Chrome rapidly overtook competitors and became the world’s most used browser by 2012. </p>
        <p> Its success spurred the development of other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)"> Chromium-based browsers </a>. While Chrome is praised for performance and innovation, it has also faced criticism over privacy concerns. </p>
        <p> It continues to dominate the browser landscape today. </p>

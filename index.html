            <p>
            A web browser is a software application that allows users to access and
            view information.
            </p>
            <p>
            The first web browser was created in 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee, the
            inventor of the WorldWideWeb.
            </p>
            <p>
            Since then, many browsers have been developed, each with its own features
            and capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
            In this document, we will explore the history of some of the most popular
            web browsers.
            </p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col">
                    <h2 id="InternetExplorer">Internet Explorer</h2>
                    <img
                    src="Logo photos/ie9logo.png"
                    alt="Internet Explorer Logo"
                    style="height: 200px"
                    />
                    <p>
                        Internet Explorer was launched by Microsoft in 1995 as part of the
                        Windows 95 operating system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It quickly rose to dominance in the early 2000s, capturing over 90%
                        of the global browser market due to its integration with Windows.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, it became notorious for security vulnerabilities, slow
                        performance, and lack of support for modern web standards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As competitors emerged, particularly Firefox and later Chrome,
                        Internet Explorer’s user base dwindled. Microsoft officially retired
                        the browser in 2022, replacing it with
                        <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge">Microsoft Edge</a>.
                    </p>

                <div class="col">
                    <h2 id="Firefox">Firefox</h2>
                    <img
                    src="Logo photos/Firefox_logo,_2019.svg"
                    alt="Firefox Logo"
                    style="height: 200px"
                    />
                    <p>
                        Firefox was released in 2004 by the Mozilla Foundation as a
                        streamlined, open-source alternative to the bloated
                        <a href="https://www-archive.mozilla.org/products/mozilla1.x/"> Mozilla Suite</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Initially named "Phoenix," it gained popularity for its speed,
                        customizability, and commitment to privacy and web standards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Firefox played a major role in breaking Internet Explorer's monopoly
                        but eventually lost significant market share to Google Chrome.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite the competition, Firefox remains a respected browser among
                        users who prioritize open-source software and data privacy.
                    </p>

                <div class="col">

                    alt="Chrome Logo"
                    style="height: 200px"
                    />
                    <p>
                        Chrome was introduced by Google in 2008, revolutionizing the browser
                        market with its speed, minimalist design, and advanced JavaScript
                        engine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Built on the Chromium open-source project, Chrome rapidly overtook
                        competitors and became the world’s most used browser by 2012.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Its success spurred the development of other
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)"> Chromium-based browsers</a>
                        . While Chrome is praised for performance and innovation, it has also
                        faced criticism over privacy concerns.
                    </p>
                    <p> It continues to dominate the browser landscape today. </p>
